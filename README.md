ZenWheels-Microcar
==================

Android app to control the ZenWheels Microcar.
The application uses the bluetooth module of the car in order to send information to the device. The API is quite straightforward and represents a 4-byte code that will be decoded by the car and translated into an activity. I have used the Bluetooth Chat example provided by the Android sdk in order to enhance communication between the two devices. The car can : steer left and right, move forth and back (with various speeds), horn :) in quite a funny way, actually and blink. This has been the best and most satisfying app I have built so far. If you are using it, have a great time !
